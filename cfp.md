## LifeLongNLP 2020: Workshop on Life-long Learning for Spoken Language Systems

LifeLongNLP 2020 is the second LifeLongNLP workshop. The programme and proceedings of the previous edition, which was held at ASRU 2019, can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/view/life-long-learning-asru19/).

## Call for papers 

The 2nd workshop on Life-long Learning for Spoken Language Systems invites papers that discuss challenges in a lifelong process of a natural language system, where new users or functionalities are added, and existing functionalities are modified. For example, in conversational agents, it’s common to add new functionalities, new languages to the existing system. In machine translation systems, it’s common to improve performance related to new users, demographics. Improving such systems often require updating training data, and statistical models to account for data distribution shifts. This workshop invites submission addressing research problems related to continuous improvement of spoken language based NLP systems. This event will be co-located with [AACL 2020](http://aacl2020.org/). 

Relevant topics include (but are not limited to): 

- Semi-supervised learning
- Active learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Incremental learning
- Domain adaptation
- Data generation/augmentation
- Few shot learning
- Zero shot learning
